<h2> hi, I'm Jackson ðŸ‘‹ </h2>


<h4>Welcome to my page ! </h4>
I'm currently a Software Engineering and Mathematics student located in Melbourne, VIC.

My main languages that I am familiar with are: Python, JavaScript/React (MERN Stack), Java, MATLAB.

Currently enjoying building trading bots and understanding various algorithms and techniques, which includes a bit of Machine Learning and models.

Besides that, some hobbies I love doing are reading, cooking (I love baking), and always finding new places to eat :)
