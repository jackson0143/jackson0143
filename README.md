<h2> hi, I'm Jackson ðŸ‘‹ </h2>


<h4>Welcome to my page ! </h4>
I'm currently a Software Engineering and Mathematics student located in Melbourne, VIC. 
A bit late to the scene, but hopefully I can learn and work with many different projects as I progress through my software engineering journey.

<br></br>

My main languages that I am familiar with are: Python, JavaScript (TypeScript), Java, MATLAB, HTML/CSS. 
This goes along some frameworks that I know (and am trying to extend my knowledge on): React (Node.js and Next.js), Tailwind, Django.

Besides that, some hobbies I love doing are reading, cooking (I love baking), and always finding new places to eat :)
